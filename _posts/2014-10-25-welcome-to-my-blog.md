Hi, I'm Nicola and I'm a student of computer engineering at [Unical](http://www.unical.it/portale/) - Universit√† della Calabria - Italy.

Welcome to the English version of my blog. I'm currently writing on my [Italian blog](http://unnikked.tk). I decided to open also this blog in order to share my experience hoping to reach far more people by using English.

This blog engine was entirely written from scratch by me, just to challenge my self.

I used [FatFreeFramework](fatfreeframework.com) and [Twitter Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com). Unfortunately I'm not a web developer guy, thoose tools helped me a lot.

I primarly use Java as my programming language, but I like to play around also with other programming languages, from low levels to high levels programming languages. I do not tend to stick with specific language, I rather prefer to work with an abstract idea and try to implement it with a random language.

I'm interested in all field of computer science and information technology, from system administration to cellular automata, from computer architectures to (try) to structuring a basic programming languages and other nerdy stuff.

Currently I'm interested on self hosted projects, particularly on self hosted web application. I'm currently using massively [selfoss](http://selfoss.aditu.de/), [wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/) and [unmark](https://unmark.it/) among others.

I will try to post on this blog as much stuff as I can.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/unnikked) and [GitHub](https://github.com/unnikked) if you want.
